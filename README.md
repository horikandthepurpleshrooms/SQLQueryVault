Let's learn SQL together!

## Overview

I plan to utilize this repository as a storage space for miscellaneous files containing SQL commands. As I progress and acquire more knowledge, I will continuously enhance and organize the structure to improve its overall appearance and organization.

## Take the first step

- Downloaded and installed SQL Ver 8.0.33 for macos13 on x86_64 (MySQL Community Server - GPL). I went [here](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/) and after choosing my Operating System and Operating System Version I downloaded the DMG Archive and installed on my machine.
- To check if installed, use:

```bash
mysql --version
```

- Downloaded and installed a SQL client that is open source: [`Sequel Ace`](https://github.com/Sequel-Ace/Sequel-Ace)
- Created first database using:

```bash
mysql -u <username> -p -e "CREATE DATABASE <database_name>;"
```

- Replace `<username>` with your MySQL username, `<database_name>` with the desired name for your database. After running this command, you will be prompted to enter your password.
- Played around with queries. üßëüèª‚Äçüíª
